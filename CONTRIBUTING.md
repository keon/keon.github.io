# Contributing to Keon's Blog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this blog! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this Hexo-generated static site.

## Important Note

This repository contains the **generated/deployed version** of the blog. The actual source files, content creation, and build process happen in a separate repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a static site generated by Hexo 4.2.0 using the hexo-theme-apollo theme. All files in this repository are compiled outputs and should not be manually edited.

## Content Structure

### Blog Posts
- Each post has its own directory (e.g., `deep-q-learning/`, `mlpack-on-windows/`)
- Posts are categorized under three main topics:
  - `db` - Database-related content
  - `mlpack` - Machine learning library content  
  - `rl` - Reinforcement learning content

### Images
- Images are organized in `/images/{post-name}/` directories
- Image directories match their corresponding blog post directory names
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

### Styling
- SCSS source files in `/scss/apollo.scss`
- Compiled CSS output in `/css/apollo.css`
- Custom fonts stored in `/font/` directory
