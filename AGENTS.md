<general_rules>
When working with this Hexo-generated static blog site, follow these guidelines:

- **SCSS Compilation**: The main stylesheet `apollo.scss` imports partials from the `_partial/` directory. When modifying styles, always check if a partial exists for the component you're styling before creating new CSS rules.
- **Image Organization**: Images must be placed in `/images/{post-name}/` directories that match the corresponding blog post directory names (e.g., images for the `deep-q-learning/` post go in `/images/deep-q-learning/`).
- **Content Creation**: New blog posts should be created in individual directories following the existing pattern (e.g., `deep-q-learning/`, `mlpack-on-windows/`, `mongodb-schema-design/`). Each post directory contains an `index.html` file.
- **Category Management**: When adding posts to categories, ensure they are properly organized under `/categories/{category}/` where valid categories are: db, mlpack, and rl.
- **Asset Management**: Generated CSS files are placed in `/css/`, fonts in `/font/`, and other static assets follow the established directory structure.
</general_rules>

<repository_structure>
This is a Hexo 4.2.0 generated static blog site using the hexo-theme-apollo theme. The repository structure follows these patterns:

- **Blog Posts**: Individual post directories (`deep-q-learning/`, `mlpack-on-windows/`, `mongodb-schema-design/`) each containing an `index.html` file
- **Categories**: Organized under `/categories/{category}/` with three main categories: db (database), mlpack (machine learning), and rl (reinforcement learning)
- **Styling**: SCSS source files in `/scss/apollo.scss` compile to `/css/apollo.css`
- **Images**: Organized in `/images/{post-name}/` directories matching blog post names
- **Generated Assets**: CSS files in `/css/`, web fonts in `/font/`, RSS feed as `atom.xml`, and `sitemap.xml`
- **Static Files**: Root-level files include `index.html` (homepage), `favicon.png`, and individual HTML files like `finding_lane.html`
- **Archives**: Archive pages located in `/archives/` directory

The site includes Google Analytics integration and Disqus comments system.

<dependencies_and_installation>
This repository contains the generated/deployed version of a Hexo static site, not the source files. Key points:

- **No Local Dependencies**: This repository does not contain `package.json`, `node_modules/`, or build scripts as it represents the compiled output
- **Source Location**: The actual Hexo source files and build process likely exist in a separate repository or branch
- **Gitignore Evidence**: The `.gitignore` file excludes `node_modules/`, `public/`, and `.deploy*/`, indicating the build process happens elsewhere
- **Generated Content**: All files in this repository are generated by Hexo and should not be manually edited
- **Deployment**: This appears to be the final deployment-ready static site served directly by GitHub Pages

If you need to make content changes, locate the source Hexo project repository where you can run `npm install` and use Hexo commands.

<testing_instructions>
No testing framework is present in this generated static site repository. This is expected behavior for a Hexo deployment repository containing only compiled HTML, CSS, and static assets.

Testing would typically occur in the source Hexo project repository before generation and deployment to this repository.
